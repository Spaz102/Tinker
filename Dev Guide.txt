Code
	Comments
		Classes - /// <summary> comment minimum
		Fns - main ones get a sum comment, where it is called from
			- helpers point to the boss Fn
		- explanatory comments go line before except for:
			- if statements, then they go in opening curly bracket
			- variable description goes same line since i'm not a madman
		- blocks of code worth visually seperating get a 3 line comment /**/
	Naming
		Variables (instances) -  camelCase -  start lc
		Classes - CamelCase start uc
		C# - lower case (if, static)
	Spacing
		- no nl for opening {
		- tabs not spaces.
	- all logical binary statements get enclosed in ()
	- large classes with multiple logical groupings are blocked by #region tags
