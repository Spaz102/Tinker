Hook.
Game is viable but dry. 
Needs to be snappier, more win loss
	? boost rates of higher level tiletypes once they've been found in past
		? or boost based on turn number
	? increase rat rate to compensate
	? make highest level goods inedible
	? chance of randomly dropped item?
	? make a simpler level, fewer steps
	- target 25~30m

Needs ______ to hold interest
	? MODES
		- Puzzle mode
			- think chess puzzles. You get a preset map, a list of upcoming tiles and a goal
				? would this be overly trivial?
		- rat trap game ... there was a cat trap game iirc
		- whackamouse/mole bonus level
		- clear/fill the board as a goal
		- bejeweled with junk -> rats
		- tower defense?
		- rat maze?
		- rat race?
	? More levels
		- have tinker build other things.... i mean... yeah.
		? levels have their own challenges
			- running water/wind... everything slides down
			- crazed rats level (start with 6, triple spawn rate) (followed or preceded by whackamole)
			- varied mode levels (puzzle, whackamouse)
			- one off power(s) just for the level... ie a grenade level
			- levels can have hard requirements for unlocked powers and recs
			- helpful rats 
				- only wander around, do no damage, can be picked up and put down at any time
				- upgrade the object they are placed on?
			- rats act in real time not turn based
	? Carryover/Between level stuff....
		? Have stuff that you build in early levels serve as parts in later levels ... basically you meta play the level.
		? If you make a part in a level (gear the level):
			? you unlock a simplified recipe for gears in all other levels
			? you put a gear on your desk that you can use once in other levels
		? unlockable powers through level completion
			- final level 
	? complexity
		- secret off codex items (get added to the codex once found)
		? more multitile constructs (think factorio)
			- 2x2 smelter ... upgrade 1 stoneline object every 5 turns
			- 2x2 woodshop ... upgrade 1 wood line object every 5 turns
			- trashcan
			- robot arm, freely move any thing within 2 tiles of it forever
		? single tile active use
			- collapses like a normal recipe but has some active use just being there (
				- robot arm could work this way. 3x3 construct collapses into a 1x1 and can be used
					- upgrade for more range
			- makes upgrades more functional since they could be used in recipes still
			- acts as a power....
		? powers
			- build a storage unit and get one permanently on your table
			- trash can ... throw something out once in a while
			- grabber... occasional use
			- smelter... put a rock in it and it changes to a metal
			- grenade 2x2 poof dmg
			- map size change
			- spyglass - see a turn in advance what you'll get
			- lucky clover - put an item on it to boost its drop rate
			- rat whistle - turn rats 'helpful' pacifying them and allowing them to be moved freely
