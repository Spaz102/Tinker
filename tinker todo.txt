Notes~
- Sounds suck (too loud?)
- Also some sounds stolen
- Needs ambiance
- Animated codex opening
- Codex unlock in-hand as well as on-board
- Initial clutter
- Finish placeholder graphics
- Needs clearer gameboard edges
- Codex as default bottom panel? (Override with options or mobile mode)
- Codex background too contrasting (Use options background instead?)
- More fitting/professional font needed
- More dust on tile placement
- Fix tiles doubling on rat spread
- Mouseover highlight boxes overlap
- Wtf ratbump->trash ghost rat?
- Handrat -> newrat recipe bugs
- Rat -> pin to easy gear?
- Rats forced wandering before hungry? (Harder to deal with if not contained)
