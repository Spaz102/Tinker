Gameplay:
	- Control times tool can be drawn (Empty board)
	- Initial clutter
	- Save system (No load/export)
	- Stick in gear recipe?
	- Some way to destroy storage? Auto-sort on gameover?

Animations:
	- Misc decorations
	- Tile unveiling (Can use grow-fade - Pings new tiles and/or codex itself)
	- Finish spritesheet

Options:
	- Mute button
	- Credits button
		- Reset button

Interface
	- Cursor position sanity
	- Mouseover highlighting on clickable buttons
	- Hand (holding arbitrary tile)
		- Scale up for mobile version
		- No hand in menus
	- More (Better) menu backgrounds
	- Codex mouseover to show clickable
	- Meaningful item texts (Unseen item texts?)

Sounds:
	- Random placement merge sounds
	- Sounds per resource? (With random pitch/tempo?)
	- Page turn codex sounds
	- Clock themed soundscape

Refine dust poof use cases
	- Rat pooping
	- ???

Mobile:
	- disable board during menus?
	- show hand on screen (codex link)
	- Standard android resolutions (540x960, 720x1280, 1080x1920)

Popups:
	- Win with deaths (animated?)
	- Win without deaths (animated?)
	- Board cleanup (gameover empty threat)
	- Main benchmarks
	- Rat breeding ("Uh oh! You're a slob!")

Tutorial:
	- Sometimes match-4+
	- Complex crafting
	- Handrat/mover
	- Storage

Eventually:
	- Kong api
	- Direct comment submission?
	- Watch ad for next n pieces prediction
	- Pay for 1-shot tool/handrat

Notes~
- Handrat + junk is getting valid match highlighting
- Sounds suck (too loud?)
- Also some sounds stolen
- Needs ambiance
- Animated codex opening
- Finish placeholder graphics
- Codex as default bottom panel? (Override with options or mobile mode)
- Codex background too contrasting (Use options background instead?)
- More fitting/professional font needed
- Mouseover highlight boxes overlap
- Rats forced wandering before hungry? (Harder to deal with if not contained)






Jello:
	UI overhaul
		- single menu system
			- codex made vertical, scrolling (a literal scroll)
				- submenus are popup lightboxes made to look like .... old recipe cards?  More papyrus that fades out on edges?
			- 3 'menu' buttons - reset (matches, dustbin), mute(gramophone?), options(metal/wood plate)
			- one 'hand' that holds the current item (for mobile version only)
		- recipe display redesign
			- []x4, [][][], animated version where multiple layouts are allowed
			- Add [x] for dead space like the gear
	Dev mode flag
		- clicking a codex item converts item in hand to that item
