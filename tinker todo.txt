Gameplay:
	- Stick in gear recipe?
	- Some way to destroy storage? Auto-sort on gameover?

Animations:
	- Misc decorations
	- Tile unveiling (Pings codex entries, and codex itself if minimized)
	- Finish spritesheet

Options:
	- Mute button
	- Credits button
		- Reset button
	- One-click mode for mobile

Interface
	- Mouseover highlighting on clickable buttons
	- Hand (holding arbitrary tile)
		- Scale up for mobile version
		- No hand in menus
	- More (Better) menu backgrounds
	- Codex mouseover to show clickable
	- Meaningful item texts (Unseen item texts?)

Sounds:
	- Random pitch/tempo
	- Sounds per resource
	- Clock themed soundscape
	- Codex/interface sounds

Mobile:
	- disable board during menus?
	- show hand on screen (codex link)

Popups:
	- Win with deaths (animated?)
	- Win without deaths (animated?)
	- Board cleanup (gameover empty threat)
	- Main benchmarks
	- Rat breeding ("Uh oh! You're a slob!")

Tutorial:
	- Sometimes match-4+
	- Complex crafting
	- Handrat/mover
	- Storage

Eventually:
	- Kong api
	- Watch ad for next n pieces prediction
	- Pay for 1-shot tool/handrat

Notes~
- Rat poop dust poof
- Junk->rat merge not hiding rat sprite during animation
- Sounds suck (too loud?)
- Also some sounds stolen
- Needs ambiance
- Animated codex opening
- Finish placeholder graphics
- More fitting/professional font needed
- Mouseover highlight boxes too small
- Rats forced wandering before hungry? (Harder to deal with if not contained)






Jello:
	UI overhaul
		- FIX storage UI stuff ... turns giant

		- CodexScroll menu system
			- side wheels on scroll to snap up or down (to show the clean desk surface)
				- movement pushes dust motes
			- glows when new item added to codex
			- Scroll contents
				- 'Menu' buttons 
					- 3~4: Reset (matches, dustbin), Mute(gramophone?), options(metal/wood plate), credits
					- near top of scroll
					- ideal UI hides mute button, shows hand if on mobile
				- Codex tree
					- fills in as new items found
					- new items glow (not blacked out)
		- 'Recipes'
			- Popup 'lightboxes'
				- leave space on sides to click (Clicking outside closes the lightbox)
			- look like papyrus that fades out on edges?
			- []x4, [][][], animated version where multiple layouts are allowed (or button to see alternate versions)
			- Add [x] for dead space like the gear
		- 'Holding' a hand holding the current item 
			- mobile version only?
	Dev mode flag
		- clicking a codex item converts item in hand to that item
