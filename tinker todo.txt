+ add popup functionality
	- mostly hardcoded, call popup(type,(msg)) ... allowing for various error msgs or w/e, and also allowing for custom popups as needed
	
+ go through all code, comment, refactor, restructure
	? rename game.cs to core (it doesn't have much actual game logic)
	? rename board.cs game-logic?
	- Comments: classes, non-stub fns, public variables, params as needed
		- use ///<summary><param name="x"><example><code>
	- reduce scope of public variables (most shouldn't need to be public)
	- determine how to divide up ui controls, popups, interactive

- change all buttons away from direct 'onclick' events so that it is all viewable from code (settings)
- write some doc about how scaling and graphics works atm...
- clean up scraps folder, reorg/move
	? audio handler should have data in it to all autocomplete on playsound()
	
- find a few audio files (paper scroll noises)

- each faux scene (that is off board for visibility in editor) should exist in a full screen size container object. This makes moving it into place easy... just make size 100% of main

+ Main

- Thematic Fonts

Core:
	- Save/load settings, tutorials seen
	- Clicking on the game board should not close the lightbox
	- Compile for web, Android
	
Bugs:
	- some tile glow fx crosses sprite borders
	- cannot support wide devices like ipads
		- slide the scroll up across page to ensure enough height
	- rat breathing a bit .... not centered on rat? using wrong metric to center breathe anim?
	
GFX Assets:
	- Tiles: log, plank, storage, Spiked cylinder, spring battery, music box
	- Codex
		- Openscroll - use ragged edge parchment as base, make taller, darker towards bottom, ruffled/flared out near scroll body
		- Closed scroll - ragged edge parchment w/ a toggle. pulled tighter to body
			- Somehow match the texture of the scroll surface
			- Mousehover shows it slightly pulled down.
		- Scroll ends - ↑↓ ui hints (Only if a really good graphic is found?)
	- Option buttons
		- Mute, credits, player stats, dust toggle, new/reset game
	- 'rotateable' icon? (Could sneak this into a tutorial, by showing it done the "wrong" way)
	- Red grid for blueprints
	- Misc desk decorations
		- Tool rack
			- Leather-wrapped rolls of tools
		- Clamps
		- Cup
		- something flat like a map, drawings/notes (hints?)

UI Code:
	- Lightbox
		- Fade out edges instead of using ragged 'page'
	- Item glow underlays? Or just using breathing?
	- Codex:
		- reveal paths as needed + pen scritching sound
		- ClosedScroll show/hide glow image when there's a new entry
		- OpenScroll
			- Draw in arrows as items are revealed (Arrows sprites as children of tile should work)
			- Mouseover to show clickable
			- Unread tiles ('breathing' glow effect)
	- LightBoxes/Recipes
		- Rearrange as per little yellow note. 1 main layout + 1 for storage + 1 for grabber
		- Update flavour text 
			- include item name (title to be removed)
			- Tinkerer pov ("It seems that you find a rock every 4th pile of dirt.... how odd")
	- Options buttons
		- Mute (Gramophone)
		- Credits
		- Player stats
	- Mobile Version
		- Hand icon on right side 'holding' current item, no cursor
		- Two-click mode (on by default)
	- Dust mote momentum tuning on scrollopen/close/scroll
		
Popups (With or without special animations, sounds, menus etc):
	- First Load/tutorial

	- Win (w/ w/o deaths)
	- Death

	+ Watch ad for next n pieces prediction
	+ Pay for 1-shot tool/handrat
	+ Levels
	+ android mini bar ads

- It is currently impossible to click (tool or rat) a tile that is wholly surrounded by storage

GFX:
	- Upscaled tileset (144 x 144)
	- Idle "animations" (?)
	- Rat poop dust poof (Needs longer duration than current poofs allow)
