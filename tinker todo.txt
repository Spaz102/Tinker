- Thematic Fonts

- make toggle for devmode get item on click

PlayerData
	- move in save/load game data code
	+ add stats (win/loss/ng)

Codex
	bug - breathing is incorrectly scaling due to anchor choice in gen
	bug - no longer breathing tiles should stop at .one scale

To singleton: Codex, Settings

+ Update flavour text to Tinkerer pov ("It seems that you find a rock every 4th pile of dirt.... how odd")
			- include item name (title to be removed)

UI
	New Buttons:
		- Stats (like in minesweeper) + Achievements
		+ Restart/Newgame
		+ credits
		+ Help? (replay tutorials)
		- Rate game button
	- change all ui buttons away from direct unity style 'onclick' events so that it is all viewable from code (settings) and we can add sounds/w/e

++++++++++++
+ Main/Code
++++++++++++

Refactor:
	Board ++
		- cut down ... does it need animations? rat control? animate poof? storage stuff?
	Core ++
	Interactive ? Does this need to exist?
	Storage ?
	? Make a Dust.cs controller
		- pull stuff from settings and core
	+ go through all code, comment, refactor, restructure
	- Comments: classes, non-stub fns, public variables, params as needed, #region comments
		- use ///<summary><param name="x"><example><code>
	- reduce scope of public variables (most shouldn't need to be public)

New Features:
	? Pregame 'main menu' screen? (New/Continue/stats/credits/)
	+ Save/load settings, tutorials seen
	- credits, player stats
	- new game
	- tutorials
	- intro/startup

Buttons/UI/Settings:
	- get rid of ui.update (make see() a function in codex)

Mobile Support:
	+ Hand icon on right side 'holding' current item, no cursor
	+ Two-click mode (on by default)
		
Codex/BP:
	? rewrite Blueprints to be a single unity object and put everything needed to load into /data (use popup as model?)
	ClosedScroll:
		- show/hide glow image when there's a new entry
	OpenScroll:
		+ Add pen sfx when new unread items are added to codex
		- Mouseover to show clickable
		- Unread tiles ('breathing' glow effect)
	BP:
		+ Fade out edges instead of using ragged 'page' .. we're writing on the scroll... maybe a zoom animation? blur?
		- beautify layouts

Dust:
	- Rat poop dust poof (Needs longer duration than current poofs allow)
	- Dust mote momentum tuning on scrollopen/close/scroll

Popups (With or without special animations, sounds, menus etc):
	- First Load/tutorial
	- Later Loads?
	- Complex crafting tutorial
	- Rats tutorial
	- Storage tutorial
	- Credits
	- Player stats	
	- loading screen
	
Audio:
	? audio handler should have data in it to allow autocomplete on playsound() ... really everything in data should be able to do this	

Bugs:
	+ cannot support wide devices like ipads
		- slide the scroll up across page to ensure enough height?
	- rat breathing a bit .... not centered on rat? using wrong metric to center breathe anim?
	+ storage bin graphic jank after merging ... only in top 2 rows
	? when filled storage is destroyed (rat/tool) the contents are deleted, is this good behavior?

+ Assets
++++++++++++

GFX:
	- codex arrows -> spritesheet
	+ Tiles: seed, stick, log, plank, storage
		- fix perspective/lighting on: rock, pin, junk3
		- shiny match spring/cylinder. Enforce metal progression
		- rat has 1px border bot/right along with some other tiles/paths? Might be a unity transparency issue?
	+ Codex
		- Openscroll - use ragged edge parchment as base, make taller, darker towards bottom, ruffled/flared out near scroll body
		- Closed scroll - ragged edge parchment w/ a toggle. pulled tighter to body
			- Somehow match the texture of the scroll surface
			- Mousehover shows it slightly pulled down.
		- Scroll ends - ↑↓ ui hints (Only if a really good graphic is found?)
	- Option buttons
		- Mute, credits, player stats, dust toggle, new/reset game
	- 'rotateable' icon? (Could sneak this into a tutorial, by showing it done the "wrong" way) (as per image in scraps)
	- Misc desk decorations
		- Tool rack
			- Leather-wrapped rolls of tools
		- Clamps
		- Cup
		- something flat like a map, drawings/notes (hints?)
	- Popups
		- Win/Lose ... gif? animation?


Audio:
	- Board sound variety
		? Random pitch/tempo? random selection? ... easy to handle in audio.playsound
	- Clock themed codex/interface sounds
	- intro (tinkerer humming)
	- lose (grumbling/desk slam/fedup?)
	- idle (creaks, humming)
	? add wind up sound before victory
	- Soundtrack/ambiance?
		- 9th century Baghdad??

++++++++++++
? Maybe?
++++++++++++

? each faux scene (that is off board for visibility in editor) should exist in a full screen size container object. This makes moving it into place easy... just make size 100% of main

++++++++++++
+ Future/Eventually/Maybe?
++++++++++++
+ generate the codex objects from data
+ Android
+ idle animations (moving stank lines)
- upscale tileset?
+ achievements?
	+ dying with only pliers and blank board

$:
	+ Watch ad for next n pieces prediction
	+ Pay for 1-shot tool/handrat
	+ Levels
	+ android mini bar ads
